## Component Notes

> [Smooch Message Template Docs](https://docs.smooch.io/rest/v1/#message-template-components)

```
format - optional
```

> The format of the HEADER component. Must be one of the following: TEXT, IMAGE, DOCUMENT. Required only if the componentâ€™s type is HEADER.

## Other Notes

- The message template name field is limited to 512 characters.
- The message template text field is limited to 1024 characters (BODY) and 60 characters (HEADER / FOOTER).
- A template can not be updated. We recommend using a test account when learning how to create templates.
- A WhatsApp Business Account can only create 100 message templates per hour.
- WhatsApp Business Account can have up to 250 message templates. That means 250 message template names, each of them can have multiple language translations. For example, a message template called hello_world translated into two languages counts as a single message template in regards to this limit.

## Notes on Deletion

> Deleting a template will delete all translations with that template name. Approved templates that are deleted will continue to work for a grace period of roughly 30 days.
> However, this also means that once a message template is deleted, that template name can not be re-used for 30 days.

## Tag Structure

```
head: [
    {
        index: number;
        type: string;
        value?: string;
        url?: string;
        prompt?: string;
        fields?: string[]; //used for csv fields or subscriber fields depending on type
    }
];
body: [
    {
        index: number;
        type: string;
        value?: string;
        url?: string;
        prompt?: string;
        fields?: string[]; //used for csv fields or subscriber fields depending on type
    }
];
```

## Notes on Tag Types

> Tags can be created for the for HEAD or BODY content types

- _index should start at 1 and increment up_

- _index of tag should match the order that you want to populate replacement tags for the HEAD / BODY_

## Notes on uploads

> Files uploads for templates are be be done via the following endpoint: \
>  `{{url}}/api/templates/upload`

> Files are to be send in a multipart/form-data \*this form can contain any keys (e.g file, image2 ) / number of files stored against these keys `(1-n files)`. This means that all files required by a template can be uploaded in a single request and referenced via the returned `"location"` field in the returned objects which can be used for the `"url"` field in tag creation.

> The s3 details used for the upload function are populated via the\
> `infra/k8s/template-depl.yaml` \
> `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID ` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY `
