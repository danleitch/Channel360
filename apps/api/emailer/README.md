#  App 

The provided code represents a basic configuration for an Express application. Below is a breakdown of the key components and features:

## Express App Configuration

- **Middleware**: Several middleware packages are used to enhance the functionality of the Express application.
  - `cors`: Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing your API to be accessed by clients from different origins.
  - `json`: Parses incoming JSON requests.
  - `cookie-session`: Handles session data stored in cookies.
  - `express-async-errors`: Enhances error handling for asynchronous code.

- **Security**: The `trust proxy` setting is enabled, which allows the application to trust the proxy headers set by your hosting provider. This is often used when deploying behind a reverse proxy or load balancer.

- **Error Handling**: The `errorHandler` middleware is used to handle errors throughout the application.

- **Not Found Handler**: Any request that doesn't match a defined route will trigger a `NotFoundError`. The `app.all("*", ...)` middleware catches all unhandled routes and throws a `NotFoundError`.

## Middleware Execution Order

1. **CORS Middleware**: Handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
2. **JSON Middleware**: Parses incoming JSON requests.
3. **Cookie Session Middleware**: Manages session data stored in cookies.
4. **Current User Middleware**: Sets the `currentUser` property on the `req` object, representing the currently authenticated user.

This script represents the startup configuration for an Express application with NATS integration and an email listener. Below is a breakdown of the key components and features:

## Initialization Process

1. **Environment Variable Validation**: Checks for the existence of required environment variables such as `JWT_KEY`, `NATS_URL`, `NATS_CLIENT_ID`, `SITE_URL`, `API_URL`, and `SENDGRID_API_KEY`. Throws an error if any of these variables is not defined.

2. **NATS Connection**: Uses the `natsWrapper` to establish a connection to the NATS server using the provided `NATS_CLIENT_ID` and `NATS_URL`. It also handles interruption (`SIGINT`) and termination (`SIGTERM`) signals to gracefully close the NATS client when the application is stopped.

3. **Email Listener Initialization**: Creates an instance of the `EmailListener` class, passing the NATS client to it, and calls the `listen` method to start listening for email-related events.

4. **Express App Startup**: Starts the Express application by calling `app.listen(3000, ...)`. The application listens on port 3000.

# NATS Wrapper

The provided script initializes a NATS (NATS.io) connection with JetStream support for event streaming. This script demonstrates the process of connecting to a NATS server, enabling JetStream, and adding a stream for handling email-related events.

## Key Components and Features:

1. **NATS Connection Handling:**
   - Connects to a NATS server using the provided URL, client ID, and authentication credentials.
   - Implements retry logic with a specified number of attempts and delay between retries.
   - Logs successful connection to the NATS JetStream server.

2. **JetStream Manager Initialization:**
   - Initializes the JetStream Manager (`jsm`) to manage JetStream functionality.
   - Implements retry logic for initializing the JetStream Manager.

3. **JetStream Client Initialization:**
   - Enables JetStream functionality by initializing the JetStream client (`_jsClient`).
   - Logs successful initialization of the JetStream Manager and JetStream client.

4. **Adding a Stream:**
   - Adds a stream named "EMAILS" with the subject "email:created" for handling email-related events.
   - Uses the provided `defaultStreamConfiguration` for stream configuration.

5. **Graceful Exit:**
   - Listens for the NATS client's closed event and logs any errors or successful closure.
   - Exits the process when the connection is closed.

6. **Exported `natsWrapper` Instance:**
   - Exports an instance of the `NatsWrapper` class, which can be used for NATS-related operations throughout the application.

## Usage:

1. **Environment Variables:**
   - Ensure that the required environment variables such as `NATS_URL`, `NATS_CLIENT_ID`, and others are defined.

2. **NATS Connection:**
   - Call the `natsWrapper.connect` method to establish a connection to the NATS server with JetStream support.

3. **JetStream Stream Configuration:**
   - Customize the stream configuration according to your application's needs.

4. **Integration with Application:**
   - Use the exported `natsWrapper` instance to interact with NATS and JetStream within your application.
