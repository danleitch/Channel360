# Utility Functions Overview

This README provides an overview of two utility functions: `flattenObject` and `createTags`. These functions are designed to handle object manipulation and tag creation based on certain criteria.

## `flattenObject`

### Description:

The `flattenObject` function takes an object (`obj`) and recursively flattens nested objects, converting them into a single-level object.

## `createTags`

### Description:

The `createTags` function generates tags based on the components provided. It identifies components with replaceable text, extracts parameters, and creates tags accordingly.
