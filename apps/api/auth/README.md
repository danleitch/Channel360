# Authentication Application
This serves the purpose of handleing authentication and authorization within Channel360. 


## How Authentication Works In Channel360 

## What is AWS Cognito?

AWS Cognito is an identity platform for web and mobile apps. Itâ€™s a user directory, an authentication server, and an authorization service for OAuth 2.0 access tokens and AWS credentials. With Amazon Cognito, you can authenticate and authorize users from the built-in user directory, from your enterprise directory, and from consumer identity providers like Google and Facebook.

## What is a AWS Cognito User Pool

AWS Cognito User Pools are fully managed identity repositories that enable developers to easily add user sign-up and sign-in functionality to web and mobile applications. They provide features such as customizable user attributes, multi-factor authentication, and account recovery, simplifying the management of user identities.

## What is a Group and how that relates to organizations and roles.

For identity and access management, within Channel360 we use groups to identify `organizations` & User Roles eg. `Admin`. Groups streamline the management of privileges, facilitating the organization of users based on shared responsibilities or functions.
